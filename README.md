### Hey there 👋

I'm Ozgur, an experienced front end engineer who is passionate about UI/UX development and technical SEO. 
I love building and experimenting with consumer-facing digital products and services which are meaningful, user-centric, fast and scalable!

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, .NET (C#, VB), SQL (MySQL, MsSQL), Node.js, Express and MongoDB 👨‍💻
* Lately, experimenting with TypeScript, Core Web Vitals (CWV), Accessibility (a11y), Web3 (dApp), Headless CMS, .NET Blazor, GraphQL, NoSQL databases and Augmented Reality (AR) SDKs (ARKit, ARCore and Niantic Lightship). 💭

A true believer and follower of XR (Extended Reality) technologies as the next emerging development platform of “creative storytelling, production and experience marketing”.
