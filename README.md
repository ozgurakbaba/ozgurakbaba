### Hey there 👋

I'm Ozgur, an experienced frontend engineer who is passionate about UI/UX development and technical SEO. 
I love building and experimenting with consumer-facing digital products and services which are meaningful, user-centric, fast and scalable!

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Node.js 👨‍💻
* Lately, experimenting with Docker, Kubernetes, Storybook, Web Components, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Accessibility (a11y), Core Web Vitals (CWV), GraphQL, NoSQL databases, and Augmented Reality (AR) SDKs (ARKit, ARCore, and Niantic Lightship) 💭

A true believer and follower of XR (Extended Reality) technologies as the next emerging development platform of “creative storytelling, production and experience marketing”.
